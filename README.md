### Custom parameters
For example, you want to put your own version of time of work and rest, in this case you must use such arguments as '-s' is that '-p' is a relaxation time.

Let's take an example like 40 minutes of work and 10 minutes of rest.
```
   python eyesave.py -s 40 -p 10
```

It is also possible to specify the number of sessions of work, for one session is considered work+rest.

To do this, use the '-c ' parameter. for example, we want to run a script with five sessions
```
   python eyesave.py -s 40 -p 10 -—Å 5
```
At the end of all sessions, the script will be disabled.
